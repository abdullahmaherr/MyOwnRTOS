# MyOwnRTOS (Real-Time Operating System)

## Overview

MyOwnRTOS is a simple and lightweight Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) implemented in C for embedded systems. It is designed to provide basic multitasking capabilities for microcontroller-based applications, allowing developers to efficiently manage tasks, priorities, and synchronization in real-time environments.

## Features

* Task scheduling: Run multiple tasks concurrently with a cooperative multitasking model.
