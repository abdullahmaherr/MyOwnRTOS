# MyOwnRTOS (Real-Time Operating System)

## Overview
MyOwnRTOS is a simple and lightweight Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) implemented in C for embedded systems. It is designed to provide basic multitasking capabilities for microcontroller-based applications, allowing developers to efficiently manage tasks, priorities, and synchronization in real-time environments.

## Features
* Task scheduling: Run multiple tasks concurrently with a cooperative multitasking model.
* Priority-based scheduling: Assign priority levels to tasks for efficient resource utilization.
* Mutex support: Implement synchronization between tasks using Mutex.
* Time management: Utilize a basic system timer for timekeeping and delays.
